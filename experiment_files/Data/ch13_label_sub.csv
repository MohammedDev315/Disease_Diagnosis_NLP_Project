OTITIS EXTERNA ,"Acute otitis externa characteristically produces moderate to severe pain that’s exacerbated by manipulating the auricle or tragus, clenching the teeth, opening the mouth, or chewing. Its other clinical effects may include fever, foul-smelling discharge, crusting in the external ear, regional cellulitis, partial hearing loss, and itching. It’s usually difficult to view the tympanic membrane because of pain in the external canal. Hearing acuity is normal unless complete occlusion has occurred. Fungal otitis externa may be asymptomatic, although A. niger produces a black or gray, blotting, paper-like growth in the ear canal. In chronic otitis externa, pruritus replaces pain, and scratching may lead to scaling and skin thickening. Aural discharge may also occur."
BENIGN TUMORS OF THE EAR CANAL ,"A benign ear tumor is usually asymptomatic, unless it becomes infected, in which case pain, fever, or inflammation may result. (Pain is usually a signof a malignant tumor.) If the tumor grows large enough to obstruct the ear canal by itself or through accumulated cerumen and debris, it may cause hearing loss and the sensation of pressure. "
OTITIS MEDIA ,"Clinical features of acute suppurative otitis media include severe, deep, throbbing pain (from pressure behind the tympanic membrane); signs ofURTI (sneezing or coughing); mild to very high fever; hearing loss (usually mild and conductive); tinnitus; dizziness; nausea; and vomiting. Other possible effects include bulging of the tympanic membrane, with concomitant erythema, and purulent drainage in the ear canal fromtympanic membrane rupture. However, many patients are asymptomatic. Acute secretory otitis media produces a severe conductive hearing loss— which varies from 15 to 35 dB, depending on the thickness and amount of fluid in the middle ear cavity—and, possibly, a sensation of fullness in the ear and popping, crackling, or clicking sounds on swallowing or with jaw movement. Accumulation of fluid may also cause the patient to hear an echo when the patient speaks and to experience a vague feeling of top- heaviness. The cumulative effects of chronic otitis media include thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, decreased or absent tympanic membrane mobility, cholesteatoma (a cystlike mass in the middle ear), and,in chronic suppurative otitis media, a painless, purulent discharge. The extent of associated conductive hearing loss varies with the size and type of tympanic membrane perforation and ossicular destruction. If the tympanic membrane has ruptured, the patient may state that thepain has suddenly stopped. Complications may include abscesses (brain, subperiosteal, and epidural), sigmoid sinus or jugular vein thrombosis, septicemia, meningitis, suppurative labyrinthitis, facial paralysis, and otitis externa."
MASTOIDITIS ,"Primary clinical features include a dull ache and tenderness in the area of the mastoid process, low-grade fever, headache, and a thick, purulent discharge that gradually becomes more profuse, possibly leading to otitis externa. Postauricular erythema and edema may push the auricle out fromthe head; pressure within the edematous mastoid antrum may produce swelling and obstruction of the external ear canal, causing conductive hearing loss "
OTOSCLEROSIS ,"Spongy bone in the otic capsule immobilizes the footplate of the normally mobile stapes, disrupting the conduction of vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This causes progressive unilateral hearing loss, which may advance to bilateral deafness. Other symptoms include tinnitus and paracusis of Willis (hearing conversation better in a noisy environment than in a quiet one) "
INFECTIOUS MYRINGITIS ,"Acute infectious myringitis begins with severe ear pain, commonly accompanied by tenderness over the mastoid process. Small, reddened, inflamed blebs form in the canal, on the tympanic membrane, and, with bacterial invasion, in the middle ear. Fever and hearing loss are rare unless fluid accumulates in the middle ear or a large bleb totally obstructs theexternal auditory meatus. Spontaneous rupture of these blebs may cause bloody discharge. Chronic granular myringitis produces pruritus, purulent discharge, and gradual hearing loss "
MÉNIÈRE DISEASE ,"Ménière disease produces three characteristic effects: severe episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss. A feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear is also common. Violent paroxysmal attacks last from 10 minutes to several hours. During an acute attack, other symptoms include severe nausea, vomiting, sweating, giddiness, and nystagmus.Vertigo may cause loss of balance and falling to the affected side. Symptoms tend to wax and wane as the endolymphatic pressure rises and falls. To lessen these symptoms, the patient may assume a characteristic posture—lying on the side of the unaffected ear and looking in the direction of the affected ear.  Initially, the patient may be asymptomatic between attacks, except for residual tinnitus that worsens during an attack. Such attacks may occur several times a year, or remissions may last as long as several years. These attacks become less frequent as hearing loss progresses (usually unilaterally); they may cease when hearing loss is total. All symptoms are aggravated by motion."
LABYRINTHITIS ,"Because the inner ear controls both hearing and balance, this infection typically produces severe vertigo (with any movement of the head) and sensorineural hearing loss. Vertigo begins gradually but peaks within 48 hours, causing loss of balance and falling in the direction of the affected ear. Other associated signs and symptoms include spontaneous nystagmus, with jerking movements of the eyes toward the unaffected ear, and nausea, vomiting, and giddiness. With cholesteatoma, signs of middle ear disease may appear. With severe bacterial infection, purulent drainage, increased salivation, generalized malaise, and perspiration can occur. To minimize symptoms such as giddiness and nystagmus, the patient may assume a characteristic posture—lying on the side of the unaffected ear and lookingin the direction of the affected ear. "
MOTION SICKNESS ,"Typically, motion sickness induces nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, fatigue, diaphoresis, and, occasionally, difficulty in breathing, leading to a sensation of suffocation. These symptoms usually subside when the precipitating stimulus is removed, but they may persist for several hours or days. "
EPISTAXIS ,"Blood oozing from the nostrils usually originates in the anterior nose and is bright red. Blood from the back of the throat originates in the posterior area and may be dark or bright red (commonly mistaken for hemoptysis due to expectoration). Epistaxis is generally unilateral, except when it’s because of dyscrasia or severe trauma. In severe epistaxis, blood may seep behind the nasal septum; it may also appear in the middle ear and in the corners of the eyes.  Associated clinical effects depend on the severity of bleeding. Moderate blood loss may produce light-headedness, dizziness, and slight respiratory difficulty; severe hemorrhage causes hypotension, rapid and bounding pulse, dyspnea, and pallor. Bleeding is considered severe if it persists longer than 10 minutes after pressure is applied and causes blood loss as great as 1 L/hour in adults. Exsanguination (bleeding to death) from epistaxis is rare."
OTITIS EXTERNA ,"ear pain, which can be severe itchiness in the ear canal a discharge of liquid or pus from the ear some degree of temporary hearing loss"
OTITIS EXTERNA ,"Swimmer's ear symptoms are usually mild at first, but they can worsen if your infection isn't treated or spreads. Doctors often classify swimmer's ear according to mild, moderate and advanced stages of progression. Mild signs and symptoms Itching in your ear canal Slight redness inside your ear Mild discomfort that's made worse by pulling on your outer ear (pinna or auricle) or pushing on the little ""bump"" in front of your ear (tragus) Some drainage of clear, odorless fluid"
OTITIS EXTERNA ,"Itchy feeling inside your ear Pain in the ear, which can be severe Your ear hurts when you move your head or gently pull on your earlobe Tenderness inside your ear Fluid drains out of the ear A bad-smelling, yellowish discharge from the ear You don't hear as well (things sound muffled)"
OTITIS EXTERNA ,"ItcEar pain is the predominant complaint and the only symptom directly related to the severity of acute external otitis. Unlike other forms of ear infections, the pain of acute external otitis is worsened when the outer ear is touched or pulled gently. Pushing the tragus, the tablike portion of the auricle that projects out just in front of the ear canal opening, also typically causes pain in this condition as to be diagnostic of external otitis on physical examination. People may also experience ear discharge and itchiness. When enough swelling and discharge in the ear canal is present to block the opening, external otitis may cause temporary conductive hearing lossBecause the symptoms of external otitis lead many people to attempt to clean out the ear canal (or scratch it) with slim implements, self-cleaning attempts generally lead to additional traumas of the injured skin, so rapid worsening of the condition often occurs."
BENIGN TUMORS OF THE EAR CANAL ,"Hearing loss, usually gradually worsening over months to years — although in rare cases sudden — and occurring on only one side or more severe on one side Ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear Unsteadiness or loss of balance Dizziness (vertigo) Facial numbness and weakness or loss of muscle movement"
BENIGN TUMORS OF THE EAR CANAL ,"Dizziness or balance problems. Ear bleeding or discharge. Ear pain. Headaches. Hearing loss. Nonhealing wound or sore. Skin discoloration, new moles or changes to a mole. Swollen lymph nodes Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) Weak facial muscles."
BENIGN TUMORS OF THE EAR CANAL ,"Pain (if cysts are in the outside ear canal or if they get infected) Small soft skin lumps on, behind, or in front of the ear Ear discomfort Gradual hearing loss in one ear Repeated outer ear infections"
BENIGN TUMORS OF THE EAR CANAL ,"Most squamous cell cancers are pink lumps that have a hard scaly surface. They often bleed easily and ulcerate. You should tell you doctor about any changes to a mole, such as the mole growing, itching or bleeding."
OTITIS MEDIA ,"Unusual irritability Difficulty sleeping or staying asleep Tugging or pulling at one or both ears Fever, especially in infants and younger children  Fluid draining from ear(s) Loss of balance Hearing difficulties Ear pain"
OTITIS MEDIA ,"Ear pain, especially when lying down Tugging or pulling at an ear Trouble sleeping Crying more than usual Fussiness Trouble hearing or responding to sounds Loss of balance Fever of 100 F (38 C) or higher Drainage of fluid from the ear Headache Loss of appetite"
OTITIS MEDIA ,"Ear pain: This symptom is obvious in older children and adults. In infants too young to speak, look for signs of pain like rubbing or tugging ears, crying more than usual, trouble sleeping, acting fussy/irritable. Loss of appetite: This may be most noticeable in young children, especially during bottle feedings. Pressure in the middle ear changes as the child swallows, causing more pain and less desire to eat. Irritability: Any kind of continuing pain may cause irritability. Poor sleep: Pain may be worse when the child is lying down because the pressure in the ear may worsen. Fever: Ear infections can cause temperatures from 100° F (38 C) up to 104° F. Some 50% of children will have a fever with their ear infection. Drainage from the ear: Yellow, brown, or white fluid that is not earwax may seep from the ear. This may mean that the eardrum has ruptured (broken). Trouble hearing: Bones of the middle ear connect to the nerves that send electrical signals (as sound) to the brain. Fluid behind the eardrums slows down movement of these electrical signals through the inner ear bones."
