OTITIS EXTERNA ,"Acute otitis externa characteristically produces moderate to severe pain that’s exacerbated by manipulating the auricle or tragus, clenching the teeth, opening the mouth, or chewing. Its other clinical effects may include fever, foul-smelling discharge, crusting in the external ear, regional cellulitis, partial hearing loss, and itching. It’s usually difficult to view the tympanic membrane because of pain in the external canal. Hearing acuity is normal unless complete occlusion has occurred. Fungal otitis externa may be asymptomatic, although A. niger produces a black or gray, blotting, paper-like growth in the ear canal. In chronic otitis externa, pruritus replaces pain, and scratching may lead to scaling and skin thickening. Aural discharge may also occur."
OTITIS EXTERNA ,"Redness of the outer ear. Itching in the ear. Pain, especially when touching or wiggling the ear lobe that may spread to the head, neck, or side of the face. Drainage from the ear. Swollen glands in the upper neck or around the ear. Swollen ear canal. Muffled hearing or hearing loss. Full or plugged-up feeling in the ear. Fever. The symptoms of swimmer's ear may resemble other medical conditions or problems. Always consult your child's health care provider for a diagnosis."

SINUSITIS ,"The primary indication of acute sinusitis is nasal congestion, followed by a gradual buildup of pressure in the affected sinus. For 24 to 48 hours after onset, nasal discharge may be present and later may become purulent. Associated symptoms include malaise, sore throat, headache, and low-grade fever of 99° to 99.5° F (37.2° to 37.5° C). Characteristic pain depends on the affected sinus: maxillary sinusitis causes pain over the cheeks and upper teeth; ethmoid sinusitis, pain over the eyes; frontal sinusitis, pain over the eyebrows; and sphenoid sinusitis (rare).Purulent nasal drainage that continues for longer than 3 weeks after an acute infection subsides suggests subacute sinusitis. Other clinical features of the subacute form include nasal congestion, vague facial discomfort, fatigue, and a nonproductive cough. Chronic sinusitis is defined as infection lasting longer than 8 weeks. The effects of chronic sinusitis are similar to those of acute sinusitis, but the chronic form causes continuous mucopurulent discharge. The location of a patient’s sinusitis pain indicates the affected sinus. For example, an infected maxillary sinus can cause tooth pain. (Note: The sphenoid sinus, which lies under the eye and above the soft palate, isn’t depicted here.) The effects of allergic sinusitis are the same as those of allergic rhinitis. In both conditions, the prominent symptoms are sneezing, frontal headache, watery nasal discharge, and a stuffy, burning, itchy nose. In hyperplastic sinusitis, bacterial growth on the diseased tissue causes pronounced tissue edema; thickening of the mucosal lining and the development of mucosal polyps combine to produce chronic stuffiness of the nose, in addition to headaches."
